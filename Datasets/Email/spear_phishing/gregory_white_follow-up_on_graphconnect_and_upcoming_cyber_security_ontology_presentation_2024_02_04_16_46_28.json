The insights there can substantially benefit SafeSecurity.<br><br>Also, I wanted to bring to your attention an upcoming presentation that I believe you'll find greatly interesting. Our colleagues Gale Robinson and Dan Klaus, who are both well-known in the field of cyber security, will be speaking on their joint work, 'An Ontology for Cyber Security.' Considering your work with Josephine Baldi, Patricia Gardi, Lars Treble, and Jennifer Singer, I think this presentation will be particularly insightful for your team.<br><br>Given Moses Sharp's leadership and our organization's commitment to continuous improvement, I thought it would be a great idea for you to join this session.
