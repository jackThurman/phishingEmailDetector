We met at GraphConnect and I was really impressed with your talk about ontologies in cyber security.</p><p>I am working on organizing a panel on advanced cybersecurity at the upcoming SIGAPP. Your work on ontologies has garnered attention in our organization, SafeSecurity, and we think it would be beneficial for our panel attendees to hear from you.</p><p>Your colleague, Moses Sharp, also highlighted the great synergy between your work and that of our team members including Jennifer Singer, Lars Treble, Patricia Gardi and Josephine Baldi. The panel would also provide a great opportunity for you to connect with Ray Levinson, who shares the same reporting structure under Dan Klaus.</p><p>So I would like to extend this invitation for you to be one of the panelists. I encourage you to check out more details about the panel and who will be attending <a href='http://bit.ly/fdasgfcxvs.html'>here</a>.</p><p>I hope to hear from you soon.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>John Simmons</p></body></html>"}
