I wanted to touch base with you regarding some upcoming events that could be of interest to you and your esteemed colleagues at SafeSecurity. </p><p>Given the success of KGC23, I have some recommendations for future events that might interest you. One of these is SIGAPP, a prominent conference on applied computing that is sure to inspire and enlighten attendees. Gale Robinson, an industry leader who you may be familiar with, will be in attendance. Gale's significant contribution to the field with 'An Ontology for Cyber Security' has made waves and his insights would certainly be enriching.</p><p>Furthermore, I wanted to bring your attention to a significant publication, authored by a revered colleague in your organization who also reports to Gale, like you do.
