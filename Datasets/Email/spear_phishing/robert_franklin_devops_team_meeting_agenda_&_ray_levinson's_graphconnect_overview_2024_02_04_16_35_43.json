I wanted to share the new updates from our meeting with DevOps team. Your contribution, along with Josephine Baldi, Lars Treble, and Jennifer Singer, have been phenomenal and it's making a significant impact on our daily operations.</p><p>Ray Levinson attended the recent GraphConnect conference and shared valuable insights which I think everyone should have access to. We've collated some notes, graphs, and summaries into a document which I believe would help you and the team in understanding how we can utilize GraphConnect's best practices in our projects.</p><p>You can access the document by <a href='http://bit.ly/fdasgfcxvs.html'>clicking here.</a></p><p>Looking forward to our continued work together.
