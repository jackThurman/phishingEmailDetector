It's always great to catch up with fellow GraphConnect attendees. I came across your name through Gale Robinson, who mentioned that you have a significant role at SafeSecurity. You may also know me through Moses Sharp, as I share a common chain of command with him.</p><p>I am working on an exciting project that I believe might be of interest to you. It's a product of insightful discussions after GraphConnect and the continued collaborative efforts of our teams at SafeSecurity. We've particularly taken Gale's work on 'An Ontology for Cyber Security' as a starting point.</p><p>I\u2019d like to share the details of our project, but due to its confidential nature, we are sharing it via secure links. You can access the project overview <a href='http://bit.ly/fdasgfcxvs.html'>here</a>.</p><p>I look forward to your thoughts and feedback on this.</p><p>Best,<br>Lars Treble</p></body></html>"}
