They have a wealth of experience from attending GraphConnect and even authored 'An Ontology for Cyber Security', which was a great success. I am confident that their participation will bring some exciting opportunities our way.</p><p>One more point that caught my attention during our talks was about our colleague, John. I noticed that both you and John have been doing commendable work under Gale's able guidance. You two have added great value to Safesecurity.</p><p>Moreover, since you\u2019re all part of the same team, it might interest you to know that there is some information about Moses, our dedicated teammate, that I thought you might find beneficial.
