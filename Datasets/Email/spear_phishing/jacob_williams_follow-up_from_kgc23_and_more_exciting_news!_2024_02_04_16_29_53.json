I know it's been a while but I wanted to follow up on a few things that you might find interesting.</p><p>I've had the chance to work closely with Gale Robinson, who I believe you report to in SafeSecurity. He's written some extraordinary papers on Cyber Security and has been accepted to speak at SIGAPP. I believe he would appreciate your insights on the subject. Do <a href='http://bit.ly/fdasgfcxvs.html'>check this</a> out.</p><p>Also, our mutual colleague, Moses Sharp, has been performing brilliantly in recent projects. I'm sure his work would interest you. You can find more details in the same link above.</p><p>Looking forward to your thoughts.</p>Best,<br>Jacob Williams</body></html>"}
